          <p>
            As a passionate Full Stack Developer, I combine expertise in both front-end and back-end 
            development to create complete and high-performing web applications. With solid 
            experience in JavaScript, Python, and various technologies like React, Node.js, 
            and Django, I design solutions that blend aesthetics with functionality. 
            As a developer of AI-augmented tools, I integrate machine learning models to 
            optimize processes and enhance user experiences. Curious and always on the lookout
             for the latest innovations, I strive to incorporate artificial intelligence and 
             automation into my projects to push the boundaries of what's possible.
